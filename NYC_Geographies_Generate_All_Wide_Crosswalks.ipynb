        "This notebook generates a complete set of wide crosswalk tables for various geographic boundaries in New York City using the BetaNYC `all_bounds.geojson` dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What this notebook does:\n",
        "- **Spatial intersections:** Computes overlaps among NYC geographic boundaries using GeoPandas.\n",
        "- **Negative Buffering:** Applies a negative buffer to each geography to ensure meaningful overlaps and exclude trivial or touching geometries.\n",
        "- **Wide Crosswalk Tables:** Produces one CSV file per geographic boundary (e.g., Community Districts, ZIP codes, NTAs, BIDs), each structured as a wide table where:\n",
        "  - Each **row** represents a specific geographic feature.\n",
        "  - Each **column** shows overlapping features from other geography types (semicolon-separated).\n",
        "- **Automated Outputs:** All generated CSV files are zipped into a single downloadable archive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Source:\n",
        "- [BetaNYC nyc-boundaries GeoJSON](https://github.com/BetaNYC/nyc-boundaries)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Requirements:\n",
        "- Python libraries: `geopandas`, `requests`, `pandas`\n",
        "- Environment: Google Colab recommended for ease of use.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "- **ZIP file**: `all_geographies_crosswalks.zip` containing individual CSVs for each geography type.\n",
