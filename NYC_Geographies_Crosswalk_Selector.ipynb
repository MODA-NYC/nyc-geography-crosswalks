        "# NYC Geographies: Interactive Crosswalk Selectors\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides interactive tools for generating two types of custom geographic crosswalk tables for New York City. It uses a comprehensive `all_boundaries.geojson` file containing multiple NYC geographic layers, generated locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important:** This notebook relies on the `all_boundaries.geojson` file being generated first by the `generate_all_bounds.py` script located within this repository (`nyc-geography-crosswalks`). Ensure you have run that script and have access to its output file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**About the Data File:**\n",
        "The `all_boundaries.geojson` file aggregates the same core NYC geographic boundaries previously used by the BetaNYC Boundaries Map project. However, the `generate_all_bounds.py` script aims to collect the **latest available versions** directly from their official sources at the time the script is run.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Note on Versions:** Currently, the specific version links (e.g., URLs containing `_25a` for data from NYC Planning's 2025 Cycle A update) are **hardcoded** within the generator script (`generate_all_bounds.py`).\n",
        "*   **Future Enhancement:** A potential future improvement could involve modifying the script to automatically check for and download the absolute latest versions available from the source portals, rather than relying on hardcoded versioned links.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interactive selectors allow you to generate:\n",
        "- **Wide-format Crosswalk**: Generates simplified tables for quick analysis of overlapping features. Each row represents one primary geography feature, and columns list overlapping features from selected target geographies (semicolon-separated).\n",
        "- **Long-form Crosswalk**: Generates detailed intersection tables including precise calculations of overlap area and percentage for each intersecting pair between the primary and selected target geographies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Workflow:\n",
        "1.  **Load Data:** The notebook first loads the pre-generated `all_boundaries.geojson` file (typically from Google Drive when using Colab - see Cell 3).\n",
        "2.  **Interactive UI**: Users choose a primary geography and one or more target geographies using widgets for both Wide and Long formats.\n",
        "3.  **Spatial Analysis**: Performs intersections using negative buffering to ensure only significant overlaps are considered.\n",
        "4.  **Custom CSV Output**: Generates a downloadable CSV file containing the results of the selected crosswalk.\n",
        "5.  **Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars display processing status.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Sources:\n",
        "The **input** for *this notebook* is the `all_boundaries.geojson` file generated by the `generate_all_bounds.py` script. The **original sources** used by that script are:\n",

        "- **Environment:** Google Colab is recommended for the interactive features and Google Drive integration. Standard Jupyter environments can also be used if data loading is adapted."
